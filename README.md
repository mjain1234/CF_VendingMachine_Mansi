# CF_VendingMachine_Mansi
This repository contains my coding for Vending machine for Cardinal Fuse coding challenge.


I have built this application using html, bootstrap and javascript.

Features:

1. User can select products (displayed using bootstrap buttons)

2. If user selects a table is shown to insert coins, in nickel, dime and quater field.

3. user can click buy. Alert will pop up to confirm the purchase.

4. If user cancel the purachase, all coins are returned.

5. Otherwise, if inserted coins are less than the price machine will ask for inserting more coins.

6. If amount is greater than the cost, vending machine will return the change.

Out of stock is also implemented, for this I am maintaining only one quantity of each. If user tries to buy same product again, 

machine will prompt for "Out Of Stock".
